# Introduction

:::warning

Formux is under constant development, and although it is stable, use experimental 
features with caution.

:::


Creating forms, inputs, validating them in real time, handling custom errors, translations, 
and many other aspects can be a huge mess if you're working in Flutter with apps that have 
hundreds of them and require complete control over them.

Formux offers a simple, elegant, and comprehensive way to create and manage all forms, 
without sacrificing dynamism or the hassle of integrating it into existing applications.

Driven by the need for a standard for form control, I began implementing it gradually to 
learn about each of its advantages.

If you encounter any unforeseen errors, potential improvements, or suggestions, please 
don't hesitate to report them. This library is constantly evolving to stay up-to-date.
